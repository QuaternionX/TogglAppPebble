TogglAppPebble
==============

A Pebble app for Toggl, a timekeeping app. Since a watch is already there for the time, why not use it for timekeeping too?

Developed by Rogier Slag with a lot of help of Joost Naaijen ([@klmz](https://github.com/klmz)) because we both use [Toggl](ttps://www.toggl.com) and would love to use our smart watches to interact with it (or stop that runaway timer easily :wink:).

Although probably the code could be done a lot better (Pebble does not allow you access to the entire C code nor the JS library) we feel many more people could benefit of this.
